  # This defines the IP that BOSH will be deployed on.
  # It should be a an IP from the static IP pool on the network
  # you are deploying the VM onto. Usually the BOSH manifest
  # will handle this via `networks`, but the IP is
  # required to create the SSL certificate for BOSH, prior
  # to deploying. If you change this, make sure to
  # have genesis regenerate your SSL certificate.
